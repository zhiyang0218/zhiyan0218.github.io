      <h3>Robotic De-Powdering System for Additive Manufacturing</h3>
    
      <!-- Introduction -->
      <p>
        In automotive manufacturing, many “green parts” require extremely high dimensional accuracy but are fragile and easily damaged. These parts are often produced using metal laser-sintering additive manufacturing. However, after printing, workers must manually excavate them from powder beds—a slow, labor-intensive process that exposes workers to metallic dust and risks part breakage.  
        This project aims to develop a <strong>fully automated robotic de-powdering system</strong> that can safely locate, excavate, and grasp delicate 3D-printed parts without human involvement.
      </p>

      </div>
    
      <!-- Methods / Design -->
      <h4>Methods & System Design</h4>
      <p>
        The system consists of two coordinated robotic arms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Manipulator:</strong> A DENSO robotic arm controlled through ROS1, equipped with a RealSense 515 LiDAR for depth sensing. This arm performs precision grasping and part placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Excavation Arm:</strong> A second robotic arm equipped with a vacuum tool that levels the powder bed and exposes deeper layers of parts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After each layer of parts is removed, the LiDAR captures a 3D point cloud of the uneven powder surface. A custom <strong>vacuum-based path planning algorithm</strong> computes the trajectory needed to flatten the surface, enabling consistent multi-layer excavation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed and improved a modular gripping mechanism in <strong>Fusion 360</strong> to protect fragile parts during grasping while supporting quick configuration changes.
      </p>

      <!-- Results -->
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>
        The prototype system successfully automated the de-powdering process for multi-layer powder beds. Key achievements include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accurate part localization through LiDAR depth sensing</li>
        <li>Reliable, damage-free grasping of fragile components</li>
        <li>Layer-by-layer excavation with automated powder smoothing</li>
        <li>Reduced manual labor and minimized worker exposure to metallic dust</li>
      </ul>
    
      <!-- Evaluation -->
      <h4>Evaluation</h4>
      <p>
        The system demonstrated strong effectiveness in improving safety and consistency. While extremely fine powder adhesion remains a challenge, the modular gripper and sensing workflow showed strong potential for industrial adoption. Future improvements include higher-resolution sensing and learning-based excavation strategies.

      <h3>Wheel-Legged Urban Inspection Robot – FDIsystems</h3>
    
      <!-- Introduction -->
      <p>
        As cities continue to expand, there is a growing need for reliable, efficient, and safe inspection of
        urban infrastructure such as industrial plants, utility corridors, and building interiors. Traditional
        inspection tasks often require human workers to enter narrow, complex, or hazardous environments.
        FDIsystems launched a new robotics division to address this challenge by developing a 
        <strong>wheel-legged inspection robot</strong> that combines the efficiency of two-wheeled balancing with
        enhanced terrain adaptability.
        The goal of this project was to create a robot capable of navigating typical urban environments, including
        stairs, small gaps, and uneven terrain, while keeping development cost and system complexity manageable.
      </p>

      </div>
    
      <!-- Methods / Design -->
      <h4>Structure Design & Internal Layout</h4>
      <p>
        The company chose a wheel-legged configuration to balance cost, maturity of control algorithms, and terrain
        capability. Starting from a two-wheeled self-balancing base, the robot is equipped with two additional legs to
        enable stair-climbing and small obstacle traversal. During my internship, I designed the mechanical structure of
        the robot and optimized the internal layout of key components.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focused on the arrangement of batteries, controllers, motors, and sensors to improve space utilization and
        maintain a low center of mass for stability. Through multiple design iterations, I achieved roughly a
        <strong>20% increase in internal space utilization</strong>, making it easier to integrate future modules such as
        sensors or communication hardware.
      </p>
    
      <h4>Assembly, Testing & Troubleshooting</h4>
      <p>
        After the design phase, I led the assembly of the prototype robots and organized structural-functional tests.
        These tests included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Balancing performance and motion stability under different loads</li>
        <li>Interaction between wheel drive and leg mechanisms</li>
        <li>Performance of new motors in serial robot configurations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During testing, we encountered stability issues in robots equipped with newly sourced motors. I traced the
        problem to incorrect motor specifications provided by the vendor and worked with the team to verify torque,
        speed, and power requirements. This prevented further integration issues and unnecessary hardware damage.
      </p>
    
      <!-- Results -->
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>
        By the end of the internship, the team had a functional prototype with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved internal space utilization, enabling cleaner wiring and easier maintenance</li>
        <li>Verified structural robustness under repeated motion tests</li>
        <li>Resolved motor-related stability issues through systematic troubleshooting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The prototype established a solid foundation for future development of urban inspection capabilities such as
        stair climbing and small obstacle traversal.
      </p>
    
      <!-- Evaluation -->
      <h4>Evaluation & Impact</h4>
      <p>
        This project demonstrated that a wheel-legged architecture can be a practical compromise between cost,
        control complexity, and terrain adaptability. While advanced locomotion such as full stair-climbing still
        requires further development, the structural design and component layout greatly improved maintainability
        and upgradability. The work also highlighted the importance of carefully validating vendor specifications
        for critical components like motors.
      </p>

      <h3>BRalgas Seaweed Fixed Bed & Harvesting System</h3>
    
      <!-- Introduction -->
      <p>
        BRalgas operates seaweed farms in tropical waters off the coast of Brazil, cultivating seaweed for
        applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Although the economic potential is high, the
        harvesting process was largely manual: workers had to jump into the water, pull seaweed up by hand or with nets,
        load it into bags, and lift the bags back onto the boat. This workflow was slow, physically demanding,
        and exposed workers to a high risk of injury.  
        Our project aimed to design a <strong>fixed-bed cultivation cage and mechanical harvesting system</strong>
        to improve worker safety and at least double harvesting efficiency.
      </p>

      <!-- Methods / Design -->
      <h4>System Design & Client Collaboration</h4>
      <p>
        As a core member of the team based in Madison, WI, I helped bridge communication between the client in
        Brazil and our design team. I initiated and chaired weekly meetings with the client to clarify user
        requirements, review design updates, and prioritize new features. Every two weeks, we delivered updated
        designs for both the seaweed cultivation cage and the crane boom to keep pace with evolving operational needs
        and constraints in the open-sea environment.
      </p>
    
      <h4>Crane Boom & Structural Analysis</h4>
      <p>
        I modeled different crane boom configurations in <strong>SolidWorks</strong>, taking into account:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Load from wet seaweed and water-filled nets</li>
        <li>Boat deck mounting constraints</li>
        <li>Operator reach, safety margins, and stability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using <strong>finite element analysis (FEA)</strong>, I evaluated stress, deflection, and safety factors under
        various loading scenarios. These simulations helped us identify suitable cross-sections and materials while
        ensuring the boom remained safe and robust under real sea conditions.
      </p>
    
      <h4>Harvesting Device Design</h4>
      <p>
        To replace manual lifting, I designed and helped fabricate a mechanical seaweed harvesting device that could
        be deployed from the crane boom. The device was engineered to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Capture and lift seaweed from the cultivation cage with minimal manual handling</li>
        <li>Interface cleanly with the fixed-bed structure</li>
        <li>Be simple to maintain in a marine environment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Early tests and time estimates suggested that the new device could <strong>approximately double worker
        harvesting efficiency</strong> compared to the original fully manual process.
      </p>

      <!-- Results -->
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>
        By the end of the project period (Oct. 2023 – May 2024), we delivered:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refined fixed-bed cage and crane boom designs that matched updated client requirements</li>
        <li>FEA-validated crane boom structures with appropriate safety factors</li>
        <li>A working harvesting device concept and fabricated prototype aimed at doubling worker efficiency</li>
      </ul>
    
      <!-- Evaluation -->
      <h4>Evaluation & Impact</h4>
      <p>
        The project demonstrated that a fixed-bed and crane-assisted harvesting system can significantly reduce the
        physical burden on workers and lower injury risk while increasing throughput. Ongoing work focuses on field
        testing in real sea conditions and refining the device for long-term durability and ease of use in tropical
        marine environments.
